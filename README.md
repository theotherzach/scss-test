Prompt Chat GPT with "how to generate a SCSS styled site to be deployed to github pages. It'll give you the general rundown.

* import additional .scss files in  assets/css/style.scss (not working right now, not sure why, might just need to start coding in that file for the time being.
* index.html has the main file

* Check the build after each push to main once you turn pages on.

* As you can see, I'm having trouble figuring out exactly how to import additional sass files. Going to remove the import line for now.

* I'm out of time figuring out that part, but this may be enough to get you started, just HTML & SCSS. You can just update files here, no local build needed.
* If you do want a local build, check out the command line tool. Have not played with it myself. https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/
* Don't sweat breaking your stuff out to different files for now, just get started in assets/css/style.scss

* If this repo is handy for you (and you can fix the SCSS import issue) then feel free to clone it down, remove the .git file, and then git init all  over again.

* OK, build passing again. Feel free to make changes in assets/css/style.scss  & index.html to get you started.
